Project Report

I started this project by planning a folder structure and deciding which files I wanted to include. 
This gave me a clear overview of all the different components and how they would fit together. 
After that, I downloaded the HTTP client using the VS Code REST client extension and went through the process of writing the code for each file. 

At one point, I ran into a problem where every line of code was not recognized by the IDE. 
Even though I had the correct imports, VS code marked all the files as they had errors. 
The first solution I tried was changing the gradle and java versions to make them compatible. 
That worked temporarily by removing all the red lines, so I continued by making all the tests. 
However, when I tried to run the tests, the same issue reoccurred. 
This time it seemed less about the code itself and more about VS code not recognizing its extensions. 
To solve this, I had to delete VS code and remove all related downloads, then reinstall it to my computer. 
After doing that, everything finally worked as expected. 
I was able to run all the tests successfully, and they passed without any issues.   

This project was my first experience with REST API where I learned more about setting up a structured workflow, 
dealing with environment issues and debugging problems that where not related to the code itself. 
I would say that the biggest lesson is to make sure all tools and dependencies are set up correctly,
and that I should probably do a factory reset of my computer.
