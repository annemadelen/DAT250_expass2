Project Report Expass 2

I started this project by planning a folder structure and deciding which files I wanted to include. 
This gave me a clear overview of all the different components and how they would fit together. 
After that, I downloaded the HTTP client using the VS Code REST client extension and went through the process of writing the code for each file. 

At one point, I ran into a problem where every line of code was not recognized by the IDE. 
Even though I had the correct imports, VS code marked all the files as they had errors. 
The first solution I tried was changing the gradle and java versions to make them compatible. 
That worked temporarily by removing all the red lines, so I continued by making all the tests. 
However, when I tried to run the tests, the same issue reoccurred. 
This time it seemed less about the code itself and more about VS code not recognizing its extensions. 
To solve this, I had to delete VS code and remove all related downloads, then reinstall it to my computer. 
After doing that, everything finally worked as expected. 
I was able to run all the tests successfully, and they passed without any issues.   

This project was my first experience with REST API where I learned more about setting up a structured workflow, 
dealing with environment issues and debugging problems that where not related to the code itself. 
I would say that the biggest lesson is to make sure all tools and dependencies are set up correctly,
and that I should probably do a factory reset of my computer. 

Project Report Expass 3

I started this project by only focusing on the frontend part and finishing a Poll that worked as intented. 
This went smooth and I had fun designing and learning React. 
When i started to connect my backend and using fetch, some problems occured. 
These problems were issues including missing code in my API or code that I needed to update in my backend part.
After going back and forth between my frontend and backend, trying to run the app multiple times and fixing bugs,
things started to work.

After this I wanted to implement a simple login, which lead to more going back and forth, changing things in both parts.
I managed to do this and then moved on to aesthetics and fixing my css file with some help from ChatGPT.
I want to continue to improve this and learn more about css later.

One issue that I need to solve is that an error message "invalid password or username" need to pop up if you type wrong when trying to login.

I also want to make a logout button.
